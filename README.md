# [Vue.js + Nuxt + Firebase - DIVERPARK ](https://diverpark.net/)

This year, 2020 I was very focused on refactor the landing page of my parent's company. 

The previous website was made with Angularjs a static pages generator based on Laravel, so I took the opportunity to redo my website with Nuxt and Vue, in order to:


* Improve performance and SEO
* Add functionality as a blog and portfolio system
* Add two languages, Spanish and English, also in blog posts but independently, since I guess I * won't translate every post in both languages.

What attracts me the most of Nuxt is the philosophy serverless (Nuxt can also be SSR tho) and the static prerendering it provides to SPA applications. Briefly, with this stack you can combine the best of a static website: compiled HTML -> what leads to a better SEO, plus the best of a single page application: Webpack, cache optimizations, lazy-loading, functions and asynchronous data...
